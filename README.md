# SBXposed
A small Xposed module which allow to avoid Xposed detection in Sparkasse(+).

## Requirements
- Xposed Framework
- Sparkasse / Sparkasse+ app at least version 3.0+
- Android 4.4+

## Usage
1. Install SBXposed
2. Activate module in XposedInstaller
3. Reboot
4. Have fun with unblocked app

## Download
You can download the mod via **XposedInstaller** or directly from [Xposed Module Repository](http://repo.xposed.info/module/tmh.sbxposed)

## Support
The module was tested by me on latest CM13 nightly for the latest version of the app. It should be working fine on other ROMs.

Please leave feedback with an Xposed log and the apk from Sparkasse(+) app if not working, so I can take a look at it.
I will not add any new features. This module is only for skipping the Xposed restriction.

I personally can not support Android <5.0 because I have no test capabilities for it.
In general, however, the module should work for the same app version.
